#HEART DISEASE PREDICTION APP
A Streamlit web app that predicts whether a person has heart disease based on input medical data using a trained Machine Learning model.
#Project Description
Heart Disease Prediction App is a machine learning-based web application built with Streamlit that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on user-input medical data. The model was trained using supervised learning techniques and integrated into a user-friendly interface, enabling real-time risk assessments. The project includes a Jupyter Notebook for training, testing, and evaluating the model, making it easy to retrain and extend.
#Features
.Predicts heart disease based on user inputs.
.Provides health warnings if risk factors are detected.
.Easy and fast user interface built with Streamlit.
.Model training and evaluation available in Jupyter Notebook.
